# ðŸ¦– T-Rex Runner! (ported to C)

![trex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3165988/120908452-565aa900-c61f-11eb-849c-7f56629657c0.gif)

This is a C port of Chrome's offline T-Rex Runner ([source-code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/neterror/resources/offline.js;l=7?q=t-rex%20package:%5Echromium$&ss=chromium)).

The port is missing a few game elements, but it's otherwise accurate:
- It's missing night mode.
- It's missing the Pterodactyl obstacle.
- It has a slightly different intro.

The build is generated using CMake, and the only dependency is SDL (including the image and mixer libraries).
